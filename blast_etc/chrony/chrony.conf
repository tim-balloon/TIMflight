# Welcome to the chrony configuration file. See chrony.conf(5) for more
# information about usuable directives.

# This will use (up to):
# - 4 sources from ntp.ubuntu.com which some are ipv6 enabled
# - 2 sources from 2.ubuntu.pool.ntp.org which is ipv6 enabled as well
# - 1 source from [01].ubuntu.pool.ntp.org each (ipv4 only atm)
# This means by default, up to 6 dual-stack and up to 2 additional IPv4-only
# sources will be used.
# At the same time it retains some protection against one of the entries being
# down (compare to just using one of the lines). See (LP: #1754358) for the
# discussion.
#
# About using servers from the NTP Pool Project in general see (LP: #104525).
# Approved by Ubuntu Technical Board on 2011-02-08.
# See http://www.pool.ntp.org/join.html for more information.

# ECM custom for TIM:
# offset and delay parameters measured by monitoring the clock time relative to a better clock (e.g. Internet NTP)
# See the chrony manual for definitions, but offset is probably
# what you want to change after observing chronyc sourcestats
# in the presence of a better clock.

# postlude: I could never get gpsd to "choose" the PPS source on the FC.
# I did, however, observe the RMS offset with `chronyc -n tracking` to be ~<10 us.
